Use the Smarket data, this data set consists of percentage returns for the S&P 500 stock index over 1250 days, from the beginning of 2001 until the end of 2005. For each date we have recorded the percentage returns for each of the five previous trading days, Lag1 through Lag5.

```{r}
library(ISLR)
names(Smarket)
dim(Smarket)
summary(Smarket)
```

The cor() function produces a matrix that contains all of the pairwise correlations among the predictors in a data set. The first command below gives an error message because the Direction variable is qualitative.

```{r}
pairs(Smarket)
#cor(Smarket)
cor(Smarket[,-9]) #except the 9th column because the Direction column is not numeric.
attach(Smarket)
plot(Volume)
```

#Logistic Regression
Next, we will fit a logistic regression model in order to predict Direction using Lag1 through Lag5 and Volume. The glm() function fits generalized linear models, a class of models that includes logistic regression.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
