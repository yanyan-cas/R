This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(DMwR)
library(car)

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(algae$mxPH, prob=T, xlab='', main='Histogram of maixmum pH value', ylim=0:1)
lines(density(algae$mxPH, na.rm=T))
rug(jitter(algae$mxPH))
qq.plot(algae$mxPH, main='Normal QQ plot of maximum pH')
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

```
